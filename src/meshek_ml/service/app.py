"""FastAPI application factory for meshek-ml service.

Entry point: ``meshek_ml.service.app:create_app``
Uvicorn launch: ``uvicorn meshek_ml.service.app:create_app --factory``

Design notes:
- ``create_app()`` is a *sync* ``def`` — required for ``--factory`` mode (Pitfall 4).
- The inner ``_build_engine_lifespan`` wraps Phase 6's ``build_lifespan()``
  in a degraded-start contract: if the model file is missing the Phase 6
  lifespan raises ``RuntimeError`` at enter; we catch it, log a warning,
  set ``app.state.ml = None``, and yield so the app still serves requests.
  ``GET /health`` then returns 503, making the degraded state externally
  visible to orchestrators (Fly.io / Railway health checks — T-8-02).
- Plan 04 will extend ``_build_engine_lifespan`` to also populate
  ``app.state.engine`` and ``app.state.catalog``; keep this wrapper
  minimal so that extension is clean.
